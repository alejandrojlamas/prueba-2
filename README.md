## Snake AI

The repository includes an automatic Snake game powered by a Q-learning
agent. After training, the game is displayed using a small Pygame
interface.

Run the original Python version (requires the `pygame` package):

```bash
python3 snake_ai.py
```

### Browser version

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to watch the snake play on a
"Back to the Future" themed interface. The page trains a Q-learning
agent for a few hundred episodes and then shows the automated game on an
HTML canvas.
